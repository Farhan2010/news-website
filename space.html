            <p>Ireland’s first space mission set for lift-off after deal with European agency


                Mon Oct 17 2022 - 20:59

                Ireland’s first space mission has reached a “huge milestone” with the signing of an agreement with the
                European Space Agency (ESA) to facilitate the launch of the Eirsat-1 satellite next year, the project’s
                director has said.

                Prof Lorraine Hanlon of University College Dublin also said there were “plenty of ideas” for possible
                future missions and how Ireland could “capitalise on all of the skills, knowledge facilities that have
                been developed so far”. A larger satellite that will build on the work of Eirsat-1 and proposals around
                space weather monitoring are among possible future projects being developed at UCD.

                A member of the Eirsat-1 team, PhD student Rachel Dunwoody, outlined how the name of the small
                spacecraft stands for Educational Irish Research Satellite and, among other capabilities, it includes a
                gamma ray detector for examining exploding stars.

                She said the researchers were currently conducting a simulation of how the satellite would operate in
                space and the team hoped to be working on the mission for five years.</p>

            <p>China’s mystery spaceplane releases object into orbit

                HELSINKI — China’s secretive reusable spaceplane has released an object into orbit, according to
                tracking data from the U.S. Space Force.

                China carried out the second launch of its “reusable experimental spacecraft” from Jiuquan in the Gobi
                Desert atop a Long March 2F rocket Aug. 4.

                The spacecraft has now been in orbit for 90 days. Two weeks ago the spacecraft raised its perigee—or the
                point during its orbit at which a spacecraft is closest to Earth—to shift to a near-circular 597 by
                608-kilometer orbit.

                In a latest development the U.S. Space Force’s 18th Space Defense Squadron has tracked an object close
                to the spaceplane. The Space-track.org database added a new entry for an object in a similar orbit to
                the spacecraft Oct. 31 (NORAD ID 54218 (2022-093J COSPAR ID)).

                The object—the nature of which is unknown—is likely in very close proximity to the spacecraft and thus
                only entered into the database once it could be discerned to be a separate, discrete object with a high
                level of confidence.

                Robert Christy of Orbital Focus notes that the release of the object could have taken place anytime
                between Oct. 24 and Oct. 31, performing station-keeping to remain close to the spaceplace.

                China has not released any updates on the mission since a terse statement announcing the launch of the
                spacecraft. No images of the craft have been published.

                This is not the first time the spacecraft has ejected an object. China’s spaceplane released an object
                around two orbits before deorbiting at the end of its first, two-day mission in September 2020. The
                object broadcast S-band transmissions for weeks afterwards.

                One possibility is that the object is a small satellite for monitoring the spaceplane. Chinese crew
                capsules have previously released ‘Banxing’ small companion satellites for monitoring purposes. It could
                also be a test for deploying small satellite payloads into orbit.

                Another possible explanation is that the object is a service module, astronomer and spacecraft tracker
                Jonathan McDowell noted in a tweet.

                Little is known about China’s spaceplane project. Chinese space authorities have closely guarded launch
                operations and only announced its two missions once the spacecraft was in orbit.

                Clues as to the dimensions and shape of the craft appeared in August however with apparent images of the
                payload fairing for the mission appearing online.</p>

            <p>Millennium Space’s Tetra-1 sets new fast-paced precedent for space-based innovation

                Designed and delivered for the U.S. Space Force in just 15 months, the small satellite catapults the
                space industry into a new era of rapid R&D.

                It took the United States eight years to design and launch Apollo 11, which finally put humans on the
                moon in 1969. More recently, NASA spent five years creating its Landsat 9 Earth observation satellite,
                which was conceived in October 2016 and launched in September 2021. Even the private-sector space
                pioneer SpaceX took nearly a decade to launch its first spacecraft, the SpaceX Dragon, in 2010.

                Although space access and technology have improved exponentially in the last 60 years, the pace of
                innovation has remained remarkably slow.

                That was OK when space was aspirational. After decades of exploration and engineering, however, even the
                most outlandish space fantasies are now within the realm of possibility. The result is a wide-open
                frontier that will yield new opportunities, but also new threats—especially in the realm of national
                security, where speed is the ultimate competitive advantage.

                “The faster that we can acquire, develop and field systems, the better off we’re going to be,” Col
                Joseph J. Roth, Innovation and Prototyping senior materiel leader for the U.S. Space Force Space Systems
                Command. “It’s widely known that our adversaries are out there, and that they’re developing systems and
                capabilities that take away our strategic advantage in space. We need to not just meet that threat; we
                need to surpass it.”

                What the United States needs, companies like Millennium Space Systems are eager to deliver. In April
                2020, it completed the design, production and integration of its Tetra-1 small satellite prototype—just
                15 months after the U.S. Space Force commissioned it. For government and industry alike, it’s a
                milestone that portends a new age of rapid research and development wherein critical space assets and
                capabilities will take months to realize instead of years.</p>
