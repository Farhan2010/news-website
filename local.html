            <p>An influx of ferrets to an animal rescue charity's rehoming centres has sparked an appeal for potential
                pet owners. The Scottish SPCA is looking after about 60 of the creatures at its nine centres, many times
                more than usual. It says a number of factors, including a lockdown reduction in hormone injections to
                take females out of season, has led to the rise. The SSPCA website currently has more than 30 ferrets
                available for rehoming. The charity's Aberdeenshire centre currently has nine ferrets, including a
                female - or jill - which has just had a litter of seven. Robert Morrison, an animal care assistant at
                the centre, said "This is much higher than normal. We used to only see about six or seven ferrets
                maximum at any point throughout the year.</p>

            <p>Would you pick pedal power over petrol? Would you pick pedal power over petrol? Close How easy is it to
                stop using the car in rural Scotland? This is what six families living in Aberdeenshire have been
                finding out as part of a pilot project. For a year, the volunteers have been given electric bikes - with
                the aim of challenging their travel behaviours. Here are the experiences of three of those households,
                in three different locations, but with the one common challenge of picking pedal power over petrol.</p>

            <p>An 11-year-old Afghan boy who spent a year stranded alone in France following the Kabul airport bombing,
                has been reunited with his twin brother in London. Obaidullah Jabarkhyl said he was "tired but happy"
                after travelling to the UK. He had been in Strasbourg after getting separated from his parents and
                siblings during the Afghanistan evacuation amid the Taliban takeover in August 2021. His twin,
                Irfanullah, made it to London to stay with their UK-based family. The boys' parents and sister remained
                in their home country.</p>
