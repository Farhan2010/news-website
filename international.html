            <p>Power blackouts hit Ukraine amid heavy Russian shelling
                Ukraine’s state electricity operator has announced regular scheduled blackouts in Kyiv and seven other
                regions of the country in the aftermath of Russia’s devastating strikes on energy infrastructure KYIV,
                Ukraine -- Ukraine's state electricity operator on Saturday announced blackouts in Kyiv and seven other
                regions of the country in the aftermath of Russia's devastating strikes on energy infrastructure.

                The move comes as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and villages with missiles and
                drones, inflicting damage on power plants, water supplies and other civilian targets, in a grinding war
                that is nearing its nine-month mark.

                Russia has denied that the drones it has used in Ukraine came from Iran, but the Islamic Republic's
                foreign minister on Saturday for the first time acknowledged supplying Moscow with “a limited number” of
                drones before the invasion. Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed, however, that Tehran didn't know if its
                drones were used against Ukraine and stated Iran's commitment to stopping the conflict.

                Ukrenergo, the sole operator of Ukraine’s high-voltage transmission lines, initially said in a an online
                statement Saturday that scheduled blackouts will take place in the capital and the greater Kyiv region,
                as well as several regions around it — Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Poltava and Kharkiv.</p>

                Imran Khan Leaves Hospital 3 Days After Being Shot In Leg
                According to news agency AFP, the sole suspect said he tried to kill Khan because his convoy was
                interrupting the call to prayer, which summons Muslims to the mosque. Islamabad: Former Pakistan prime
                minister Imran Khan left the hospital on Sunday, a senior aide said, three days after being shot in the
                leg in a failed assassination attempt.
                The shooting -- and Khan's accusation that his successor Shehbaz Sharif was involved -- have
                significantly raised the political temperature in a country that has been on the boil since he was
                ousted in April.

                Former information minister Fawad Chaudhry told AFP that Khan "has been discharged" and a local TV
                channel showed him wearing a blue hospital gown as he left the Lahore clinic by wheelchair.</p>

            <p>Reclaim the runway: $8 billion project to transform shuttered Berlin airport into an eco city At the
                former Tegel Airport on the outskirts of Berlin, Germany, workers keep uncovering bombs. The residue of
                the Prussian military and two world wars lingers at the 495-hectare site, which became home to city's
                main airport in the 1970s, before it fell out of favor and closed in 2020. When the airport was built,
                land used for runways and around three meters either side were cleared, while other areas were left.
                Since May 2021, over 10 tons of explosives and ammunition have been moved or safely detonated from 20
                hectares.
                But unlike the antique ordnance, Tegel will not lie dormant for long. Because its hulking brutalist
                terminal, winding corridors -- even its flight control tower -- have already found a new purpose. Thanks
                to an €8 billion ($7.9 billion), multi-decade investment, it's on a path to become one of the most
                ambitious smart cities in Europe.
                The project, dubbed Berlin TXL, has been designed as a climate-friendly community full of sustainable
                technologies, with integrated university campus and innovation hubs to propel these technologies into
                the future. It's pitched as the next chapter in urban living that wants to write the chapters after that
                too.
                Commissioned by the State of Berlin and building on publicly-owned land, developer Tegel Projekt is
                collaborating with the public sector and private companies and investors on the Schumacher Quartier, a
                pedestrianized community of approximately 5,000 homes, and The Urban Tech Republic, an area for 5,000
                students and up to 1,000 businesses.

            <p>Tanzanian Precision Air plane crashes into Lake Victoria A Tanzanian passenger plane has crashed into
                Lake Victoria as it attempted to land in the lakeside town of Bukoba, killing at least three people.

                The Precision Air flight was carrying 43 people, 26 of whom have been rescued and sent to hospital, an
                official said.

                The two pilots survived the crash but remain trapped inside the cockpit and have been speaking to local
                officials.

                Rescue workers and local fishermen are on the scene trying to rescue those still inside the aircraft.

                Emergency workers have used ropes to pull the ATR-42 aircraft closer to the shore, and some of the
                plane's body is now above the water. Immediately after the crash, the plane was almost completely
                submerged with only the brown and green tail fin visible.

                One end of the runway at Bukoba airport lies right next to the shore of Lake Victoria, Africa's largest
                lake.

                Top regional official Albert Chalamila said that three bodies had been recovered so far following the
                crash, which has been blamed on bad weather.

                President Samia Suluhu Hassan has expressed her condolences to those affected and called for calm as the
                rescue operation continues.

                The plane was flying from Tanzania's biggest city, Das es Salaam, to Bukoba via Mwanza.

                Precision Air is Tanzania's largest private airline and is partly owned by Kenya Airways. It was founded
                in 1993 and operates domestic and regional flights.</p>
