            <p>UK weather: More flash floods and travel chaos expected across South East

                More disruption is expected as parts of Britain face thunderstorms after torrential downpours led to
                rush-hour flooding.

                New weather warnings have been issued for heavy showers and thunderstorms on Thursday evening, which the
                Met Office said are likely to bring some disruption.

                Parts of London endured more than half a month's worth of rainfall in one night as people woke to
                downpours, flooded roads and transport problems.

                In the south east of England, some train and underground services were hit by cancellations and delays.

            <p>A climate change-induced natural disaster has struck India every day of 2022 so far, new CSE report shows

                Climate change has never been fair. While the battle remains a global effort, the disproportional manner
                in which climate disaster tramples on the weakest makes it an achingly cruel opponent. For example,
                despite exhibiting one of the lowest per-capita emissions in the world, India stands to be one of the
                worst affected. The cataclysmic cogs of climate events have already begun turning, with a new report
                mourning that India has witnessed a natural disaster almost every day of 2022 so far.

                The report, released in collaboration between the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down To
                Earth magazine, assesses that out of the 273 days between January 1 and September 30, some form of
                extreme weather event shrouded some part of India in tragedy for 242 of them — or 88% of the time.

                Additionally, the sheer range of the disaster types seems eyebrow-raising. India simultaneously recorded
                one of the wettest Januaries and one of the driest Marches in over 120 years. In addition, eastern and
                northeastern India recorded abnormally cold day and night-time temperatures in February, which can be
                devastating for crop growth due to frost development. This too can be attributed to climate change,
                which is making these kinds of record-breaking events occur more frequently then they shou.</p>

            <p>11 killed as powerful Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan

                In Japan, eleven people have been killed and fifteen others missing after the most powerful typhoon hit
                the country.

                Typhoon Hagibis is expected to head out to sea on Sunday evening once it churned its way up the
                northeastern coast and the northern island of Hokkaido</p>

            <p>First Alert Weather: Northeast Florida will see impacts from tropical disturbance next week JACKSONVILLE,
                Fla. — Action News Jax First Alert Chief Meteorologist Mike Buresh said a major storm will hit the local
                area next week.

                Buresh said there are still plenty of question marks when it comes to exact details, but in a general
                sense – in terms of wind & rain – there will be widespread impacts.   Here is what to expect:

                Breezy onshore winds this weekend will help “set the table” for next week.
                Rough seas, surf and dangerous rip currents will already occur through the weekend.
                Already “softened” beaches (Ian and previous nor’easters) will be ripe for the “picking” with such a long stretch of strong, onshore flow/winds.
                Conditions will worsen Monday and likely be at their peak Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, possibly into Friday, even Saturday.

                Winds gusts 30-40+ mph at the beaches, 15-25+ mph inland.
                Rough seas and surf with very dangerous water conditions/rip currents. Surf will be nearing 10 feet & even greater than 10 feet by Tuesday through much of the rest of the week.
                Sea water will likely breach some of the dunes & probably many of the dunes that were damaged by Ian.
                Rainfall will be heavy at times and will increase each day through next week.
                The storm system responsible – low pressure – may or may not become “Nicole” but either way the impacts will be virtually the same.

                If the storm goes more toward south Florida, it’s *possible* it could be stronger, *maybe* even hurricane strength BUT far from certain.
                Bottom line: Be prepared for rough weather & a busy weather week. The one thing that impacts everyone over the next week will be weather.
                Election Day: Windy with on-&-off showers.
