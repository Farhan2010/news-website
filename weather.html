            <p>UK weather: More flash floods and travel chaos expected across South East

                More disruption is expected as parts of Britain face thunderstorms after torrential downpours led to
                rush-hour flooding.

                New weather warnings have been issued for heavy showers and thunderstorms on Thursday evening, which the
                Met Office said are likely to bring some disruption.

                Parts of London endured more than half a month's worth of rainfall in one night as people woke to
                downpours, flooded roads and transport problems.

                In the south east of England, some train and underground services were hit by cancellations and delays.

            <p>A climate change-induced natural disaster has struck India every day of 2022 so far, new CSE report shows

                Climate change has never been fair. While the battle remains a global effort, the disproportional manner
                in which climate disaster tramples on the weakest makes it an achingly cruel opponent. For example,
                despite exhibiting one of the lowest per-capita emissions in the world, India stands to be one of the
                worst affected. The cataclysmic cogs of climate events have already begun turning, with a new report
                mourning that India has witnessed a natural disaster almost every day of 2022 so far.

                The report, released in collaboration between the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down To
                Earth magazine, assesses that out of the 273 days between January 1 and September 30, some form of
                extreme weather event shrouded some part of India in tragedy for 242 of them â€” or 88% of the time.

                Additionally, the sheer range of the disaster types seems eyebrow-raising. India simultaneously recorded
                one of the wettest Januaries and one of the driest Marches in over 120 years. In addition, eastern and
                northeastern India recorded abnormally cold day and night-time temperatures in February, which can be
                devastating for crop growth due to frost development. This too can be attributed to climate change,
                which is making these kinds of record-breaking events occur more frequently then they shou.</p>

            <p>11 killed as powerful Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan

                In Japan, eleven people have been killed and fifteen others missing after the most powerful typhoon hit
                the country.

                Typhoon Hagibis is expected to head out to sea on Sunday evening once it churned its way up the
                northeastern coast and the northern island of Hokkaido</p>

            <p>An 11-year-old Afghan boy who spent a year stranded alone in France following the Kabul airport bombing,
                has been reunited with his twin brother in London. Obaidullah Jabarkhyl said he was "tired but happy"
                after travelling to the UK. He had been in Strasbourg after getting separated from his parents and
                siblings during the Afghanistan evacuation amid the Taliban takeover in August 2021. His twin,
                Irfanullah, made it to London to stay with their UK-based family. The boys' parents and sister remained
                in their home country.</p>
